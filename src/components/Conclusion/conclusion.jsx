By focusing on making restaurant addresses more visible, streamlining the menu display, introducing a ratings filter to simplify review navigation, providing detailed calorie information, and including serving size details, these changes aim to reduce cognitive load and improve navigation efficiency. The introduction of a ratings filter specifically helps users quickly find the most relevant reviews, further tailoring the browsing experience to individual needs. These enhancements are designed to provide users with a more intuitive and informative experience, ensuring that they can make well-informed decisions quickly and effortlessly. This project reflects a deep understanding of user needs and demonstrates a commitment to enhancing the usability and functionality of the DoorDash app, making it a more valuable tool for everyday use.</p>
