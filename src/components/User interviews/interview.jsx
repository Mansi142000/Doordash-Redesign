                <p>The insights derived from user interviews proved invaluable in gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives. Four interviews were conducted with individuals ranging from 20 to 41 years old. Each participant was invited to share their thoughts and emotions upon encountering a restaurant menu page on DoorDash. The interview questions included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How frequently do you utilize DoorDash?</li>
                    <li>What initial impressions come to mind when you browse the menu of a specific restaurant?</li>
                    <li>Do you typically have a predetermined order in mind or do you explore the menu options?</li>
                    <li>Is the menu navigation user-friendly in your experience?</li>
                    <li>How much time do you usually spend selecting an item to order?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever encountered any difficulties or frustrations while using DoorDash's menu interface?</li>
                    <li>How important are factors such as menu layout, images, and descriptions when making your decision?</li>
                    <li>Are there any specific features or improvements you would like to see in DoorDash's menu browsing experience?</li>
                    <li>Do you usually stick to familiar restaurants or do you enjoy exploring new options?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever abandoned an order midway through the menu selection process? If so, what caused you to do so?</li>
                </ol>
